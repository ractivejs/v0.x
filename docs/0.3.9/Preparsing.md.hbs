title: Preparsing Templates
---
Before Ractive can render a template, it has to *parse* it. Parsing consists of reading the HTML and constructing a tree-like structure that represents the structure of the HTML, but also [[mustaches]] and their [[references]] or [[expressions]], along with any other concepts that aren't represented by HTML such as [[transitions]] and [[event proxies]].
