This is a set of globally-available (i.e, shared between all Ractive instances) [transition functions](transitions). If an element with a specified `intro` or `outro` is added or removed, Ractive will first try to find the transition function on [ractive.transitions](ractive-transitions-instance) - if it fails, it will then look in `Ractive.transitions`.

A few standard transition functions are included 'out of the box', such as `fade`. (Pull requests welcome!)

You can add your own transitions - they should adhere to the [transition API](transitions#creating-transitions).
